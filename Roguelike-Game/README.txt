Final Assignment: Dungeon Levels and PC Stats

Added strength, dextarity, constitution, and sight stats to the pc. 
Strength increases damage by 10% for each skill point. Dexterity increases 
speed by 5% for each point. Sight increase vision distance by one grid space. 
Constitution increases max health by 25% for each point.

Add skill points by clicking 'a' and then '1-4'

Added dungeon levels. Monster descriptions now have a level requirement. 
Going through the dungeon via the up-staircases increases the dungeon level 
by one. Monsters have to have a level requirement less than or equal to the 
dungeon level to be able to spawn
